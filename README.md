# WordPress Utils
Some of my personal tools to work with WordPress.

* [Shell script to install WP (it requires wp-cli)](https://github.com/adrianosferreira/WordPress-Utils/blob/master/wp-install.sh)

This is a shell script example which does install WP latest version in a domain, configures the hosts file and copy/install WPML plugins (already sit in wpml.dev local folder). Some modifications must be done to fit your needs.
